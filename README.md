# California Education Funding Equity Analysis

This repository contains our analysis for **A2D2 Milestone Project**, examining per-pupil spending across California public school districts.  
We explored how **demographic composition** (i.e., race, ethnicity, & student status) and **geographic context** affect funding patterns under the state's Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF, 2013).

---

## ðŸ§  Project Overview
Our analysis addressed:
1. How **student demographics** correlate with per-pupil spending.  
2. Whether district **locale type** (City, Suburban, Town, Rural) influences funding even after controlling for student need.  
3. Which racial/ethnic and socioeconomic groups are the most & least represented in districts receiving higher funding.
